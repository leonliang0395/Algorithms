Longest Palindromic Substring
O(N^2) Time O(1) Space:
  - For each letter, expand left + right till you find the biggest substring.

Trim Strings
    // trim from start (in place)
    static inline void ltrim(std::string &s) {
        s.erase(s.begin(), std::find_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](int ch) {
            return !std::isspace(ch);
        }));
    }

    // trim from end (in place)
    static inline void rtrim(std::string &s) {
        s.erase(std::find_if(s.rbegin(), s.rend(), [](int ch) {
            return !std::isspace(ch);
        }).base(), s.end());
    }

Find the profit of the best trade in stock
    - Max Diff Technique
    - Keep track of the minimum_price so far, and for each element, check if the difference between minimum and this element
      is greater than the max profit so far.
    - Also update minimum_price if you find a lower price.
    
Find the best two profits in an array of stock prices
    - You essentially need to iterate through each element in the array.
        - For each iteration, you have to check the best prices in the subarray before the element, and after the element.
        - To do this, you need to have two functions to find the best price in subarr(0, i) and in subarr(i + 1, size).

Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
- This assumes that nodes have a parent pointer
- Find the depth of the two nodes.
- Bring the node that's deeper, up to the same depth of the other node.
- Then move both up at the same time until they meet. That is the LCA.
