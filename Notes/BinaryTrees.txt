Binary Tree Properties
- Balanced Tree
  - Depth of Leaf nodes <= 1 between each other.
  - A binary tree with height h can have a maximum of 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes. 
    This will happen if all nodes have 2 nodes.

- Preorder Traversal
  - print data
  - visit left
  - visit right

- Inorder Traversal
  - visit left
  - print data
  - visit right

- Postorder Traversal
  - visit left
  - visit right
  - print data

Top To Bottom Approach
- Evaluate the result for the current node, then pass it on to left and right nodes to evaluate 
  for themselves. There's usually a variable that holds the result. 
- Pass the variables down to the children nodes to update. After entire tree is traversed, the 
  variable will hold the result.
