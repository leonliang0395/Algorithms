Expression Evaluation
- You'll have two stacks: one for operands and one for operators.
- As you push operands annd operators, if you encounter an operand that has higher or equal precedence to 
    the operand on top of the stack, you evaluate the operator on the top of the stack and push the result
    to the operands. Then you check again if the operator on top of the stack has higher or equal precedence to 
    the operator coming in. Repeat until there's lower precedence or you've run out of operators.
